IMPORTANT: this extension will break your Bugzilla unless you have the 3-line
patch from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1082106 .

If you are running any of the following versions or later, you are OK:

* trunk after 2014-10-24
* 5.0
* 4.5.7
* 4.4.7

You will need to apply it to all installations running 4.2 or earlier.

*******************************************************************************
You need to apply the patch _before_ running checksetup.pl. Failure to do so
will break your Bugzilla, and applying it afterwards won't un-break it.
